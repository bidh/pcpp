Exercise 4.3

6. Not really. The execution is almost the same (~half a second) for both versions:
sequential and parallel. Maybe because the computation is too simple.

12. The parallel version is very slow. It didn't even finish after 1m and 30s. 

13. Using groupingByConcurrent in the example above made the parallel version really fast.
It is twice as fast as the sequential one! 
Parallel runs in 10s while sequential in 20s.

Exercise 4.4

2. The parallel version is three times faster than the sequential one.
Parallel runs in 4s while sequential in 12s.

4. Takes ~10 seconds

5. We get different results while running the program more times. The DoubleSupplier object
in this case has state which changes (i.e. private int current). As we have mentioned, 
we should not use mutable objects in parallel computations unless their changes are 
synchronized (which is not the case in this particular example).
